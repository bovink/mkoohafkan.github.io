Welcome to my research blog! My name is Michael Koohafkan. I am a PhD student in [Hydrologic Sciences Graduate Group](http://hsgg.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California Davis working with [John Largier](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/research/faculty/john-largier/). I research sediment transport, ecohydraulics and stochastic hydrology in fluvial and coastal systems. I also have a Master's degree in Environmental Engineering from the University of California Berkeley, where I researched fog hydrology and applications of distributed environmental sensor networks for climatological studies, so you'll see a few posts about that too.

I will use this blog in part to disseminate my research findings, but also as a place to discuss works in progress, share problem solving strategies (including code!) and talk about the trials and tribulations of pursuing a PhD in hydrologic sciences. I hope you will check back often!
