I am a PhD student in the [Hydrologic Sciences Graduate Group](http://hsgg.ucdavis.edu/) at University of California Davis. I started the
doctoral program in late 2014 following completion of a Masters of Science in 
[Environmental Engineering](http://efmh.berkeley.edu) at University of 
California Berkeley, where I studied the role of fog in the hydrology of 
coastal watersheds in California. My doctoral research is focused on sediment 
transport and geomorphologic processes in large sand-bedded rivers; 
specifically, I collaborate with the 
[USACE Hydrologic Engineering Center](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/)
to understand the morphodynamics of inter-channel emergent sandbars in the 
Missouri River. I have also collaborated with NOAA's 
[Habitat Blueprint](http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/habitatblueprint/) to 
explore the hydrologic controls on salmonid habitat quality in the 
[Russian River estuary](http://www.scwa.ca.gov/russian-river-estuary/), and 
with the [American Bird Conservancy](https://abcbirds.org/) on the development 
of an [agent-based model](http://www.leasttern.org/) of Interior Least Tern 
breeding behavior.
