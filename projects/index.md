## Open-source software for 1D hydraulic simulations

The [rivr](/projects/rivr) package for R is a free and open-source
software package for open-channel flow simulation in 1D. Check out 
my [article](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015-2/koohafkan-younis.pdf) 
in the R Journal for more information, or download it from 
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rivr/index.html).

## Assessing salmonid habitat in the Russian River estuary

As part of my work on the 
[NOAA Habitat Blueprint](https://www.habitatblueprint.noaa.gov/) for
the 
[Russian River Estuary](https://www.habitatblueprint.noaa.gov/habitat-focus-areas/russian-river-california/),
I developed a 
[shiny application](/projects/habitatblueprint) 
for exploring salmonid habitat based on CTD transect data.

## Analyzing HEC-RAS sediment simulation data

As part of my work with 
[HEC](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/), I routinely calibrate and
validate sediment transport models. I developed the 
[RAStestR](/projects/rastestr) package for R to make it easier to
read and manipulate 
[HEC-RAS](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/) 
sediment transport simulation outputs.

## Analyzing hydrologic regime and environmental flow indicators

As part of my dissertation research on the geomorphic processes 
that build and maintain 
[emergent sandbar habitat](http://moriverrecovery.usace.army.mil/mrrp/f?p=136:132:0::NO:::)
in the Missouri River, I developed the 
[flowregime](/projects/flowregime) package for R to
  compute environmental flow indicators, including
  the standard outputs of 
  [IHA](https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationPractices/Freshwater/EnvironmentalFlows/MethodsandTools/IndicatorsofHydrologicAlteration/Pages/indicators-hydrologic-alt.aspx).
